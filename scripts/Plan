-- ?create the grid 
--  ? use a for loop and the cellCount variable 
--   ?create a new variable for creating new divs for each cellCount
  -- ?give indiv cells dataset index of i - to give them numbers that can then be accessed for moving aliens around etc
--   then add enemies function 

-- gets the high score

-- sets a high score 
--   if current score > highest score, highest score = current score. 

--   starts the game 
--   adds correct amount of aliens to grid 
--     num of aliens = width -3 

-- moves the aliens 
--   while loop - while divs contain aliens: 
--     move aliens one div at time to the right - in an interval of 2 seconds 
--     if divs 14 contain alien - run function shiftDown()
--     then move aliens one div at a time to the left - interval of 2 seconds 
--     if divs 0 contain alien - run function shiftDown()

--     function that moves aliens down a row - shiftDown()    
--   drops alien bombs 
--    give this more thought 
--     random number to shoot back 
-- removes aliens 
-- ?moves the player 
--   ?if statements - using keyCode for left and right keys - all others invalid keys
--   if placebar hit run function playerShot()
-- player shooting 
--   space bar key code results in shot fired. 
-- end the game
--   clear the interval 
  




-- ! data 
-- imgaes for enemy
-- images for player 
-- bakcground image 
-- add sound to the background 



-- !firing:
-- needs to be on an quick interval 
-- in each interval, shot moves down one square 
-- if square shot moves into contains player - player looses a life 


-- * --- order ---
-- first need to target the elements that will be interacting with . 
-- then will create variable needed

-- ?create the grid and the div classes through js instead of hard code 
--  ? will do this by using a function. going to use a for loop, with i being less then the cellCount (which is one of the variables)
--   ?through each iteration of the loop, a cell (div) will be added to the grid using the createElement('div') and will be saved to a variable called cell. 
--   ?will then add the index of each cell to the data attribute on the element y using .dataset.index = i
--   ?these cells will then be added into the cell array, but pushing them into the array 
--   ?then append the cells to the grid element by using appendChild. 
--   at the end of this function we can call the function that adds aliens to the board. 

-- create a function the will place the alien on the board
--   start by just adding one alien to the board - and try get it to listen to the function that will make it move across and the down when it meets a wall 
--   once that is working come back and create more aliens. 
--   want length of enemy to be width - 3 - then they have move time to move across. 
--   add aliens by putting a position placeholder into the function parentasis, then add the alien classlist to the the position of cell cells[position].classList.add('alien')
--     make the aliens into a class, and add them into the grid in starting position - making them all a class means they can move in unison 

-- make the function to get them to move across the board - and when they reach the sides, move down a row. 
--   irst will need to remove alien function from current position - then run interval that will move the class across together
--   needs to be an interval 
--     needs to be an if statement inside of the interval - where if the currentposition of cells with the class of alien inside % width === width -1
--     prevent them falling off the board. 
--     move to all cells 1 to the right
--     else move the cells down one 

-- make the function that will end the game when the enemy reaches the final row 
--   if stamtement that:
--   needs to clear the enemy interval 
--   and return to original setup 
--     if enemy current position === bottom row (currentPosition + width <= cellCount - 1)- do the above. 
--     will need a set timeout - that will then show the final score, once rest of the function had finished. 

-- ?create the player 
--   ?function addPlayer(position ){ cells[position].classList.add('player')}

-- ?create the function that moves the player left and right. 
--   ?first will remove player from current player location - then run if statements
--   ?will need event listeners on left and right key, using the key codes 
--   ?need to set it so they cannot move up of down off the bottom row - and cannot move off the board left and right 
--     ?will be four if statements. 
--     ?dont need up and down 
--     ?after the if statment - call the player function to the current position
--     ?eventListener = keydown 

-- create function for player firing 
--   will add an event listener to the keycode of the space bar. when space bar is hit, interval will begin, that moves the shot up the page 
--   if a div ontains the enemy class at the shot travels up - then the enemy class is removed, and the shot class is removed - to prevent it for continuing up 
--   the player will get 50 points per enemy hit. 
--   vent listener needs to be key up - so they cant just continuously fire. 

-- reate function for enemy firing
--   will be an interval inside the function
--   ill need a math.floor(math.random) * bottom row length- for only the bottom line of aliens 
--   this will pick out a random alien, which from the row below that position - a shot will be fired down on an interval - until it reaches the bottom
--   if the player is hit - then a life is lost and remove shot class 
--     pdate the innerHTML of the lives 

-- unction to set high scroe: 
--   if current score > highest score, update highest score with current score. 


--   all the above needs to be inside of the createGrid function. 


--  !if get all the above done:
-- ! ---- possible extras -----

-- add a landing page with the instructions and move the start button to the page 
--  if the player wins - they move to level two, where the interval for the aliens to move becomes less, along with the aliens firing time.
